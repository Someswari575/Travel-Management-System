# Travel-Management-System


## 1. About the Project
This project is a Travel Management System developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Vite, React, and Node.js. It allows users to book tickets, access travel-related services, and obtain contact information. The application includes both front-end and back-end functionality to manage user interactions, data processing, and dynamic content.


## 2. Main Objectives
- To provide an easy platform for booking travel tickets
- To display various travel services and related information
- To manage user interactions efficiently through dynamic content
- To ensure responsive design across different devices


## 3. Functional Highlights
The system allows users to search for available travel options and book tickets based on their preferences. It dynamically updates content using React components and communicates with the backend for processing user requests. Users can also access service details and contact information through dedicated sections of the application.


## 4. Tools and Technologies
- HTML for structuring web pages
- CSS with Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness
- JavaScript handles client-side logic
- React with Vite is used to build a fast and modular front-end
- Node.js is used on the server side to manage requests, process data, and support application functionality


## 5. System Behavior
User actions such as searching, booking, and navigating between pages are handled through event-driven programming. Forms are used to collect booking details, which are then processed by the backend. The application updates the interface dynamically.


## 6. Interface Design
The user interface consists of a homepage, travel search and booking section, service listings, and a contact page. Navigation components allow users to move easily between different sections of the application. The layout is responsive and adapts well to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.


## 7. How to Use the Application
Users can open the application in a web browser and explore available travel options. By selecting a suitable service and entering the required details, tickets can be booked easily. Additional information such as services and contact details can be accessed through the navigation menu.


## 8. Final Summary
The Travel Management System offers a practical solution for managing travel bookings and related services. By using modern frameworks and backend integration, the project demonstrates effective web application development and provides a scalable foundation for future improvements.
